# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Brain-Lesion-Segmentation-in-MRI-Images
In this work, three popular deep convolutional neural networks (U-NET, DeepLab, and SegNet) for image segmentation are constructed and compared. This comparison reveals the tradeoff between achieving effective segmentation and segmentation accuracy. Using deep learning, specifically convolutional neural network methods, to build and train models, brain lesions can be identified from MRI images. After the model was able to identify brain injury, the deep learning model was improved by adjusting the model structure, implementing data enhancement, and searching for optimal hyperparameters. We also elaborate on the implementation details and evaluation criteria to improve its segmentation benchmark and performance based on the original model.
